How to play?

In the realm of “WHE WHE”, to participate, a customer MUST choose 5 numbers and then assign a money value to their ticket. The more money a customer attaches to their ticket, the higher their pay out would be if their 5 selected numbers are drawn.

Unselect Option: The cashier is allowed to unselect the numbers. If a number is unselected, it is removed from the Numbers Selected Section and the appropriate button is changed back to its initial color.

Assign money value: After the 5 numbers are selected, the cashier has to assign a money value to the customer’s ticket. For example, if the customer wants to play $23.00 on their ticket, then the cashier can hit the $20 money value button once and then hit the $1.00 money value button 3 times. Note, this can ONLY be done after the cashier selects the 5 numbers. If the cashier tries to assign money before selecting the 5 numbers, they are alerted that they can’t do so.

Clear Button: When the cashier hits the “Clear” button, all selected numbers are cleared and unselected. Also, if money value was assigned, that is cleared too. 

Random Button: When the cashier presses the random button. The system randomly select 5 random numbers, and add them to the “Numbers Selected Section”.

Cash Button: Displays the numbers selected and the money value assigned when the cashier presses the “Cash” button.
